For serial simulation, cd serial
run make and it will generate a program called test_serial
To run this program, 

./test_serial [num_of_rows] [num_of_cols] [generation] [input_name] 
[output_name]

To test the validity of sequential program, a file called samll_input_5*5 is available.
One can run it

./test_serial 5 5 5 small_input small_output.

After validating the correctness of this program, one can run 

./test_serial 500 500 5 large_input large_output. And then compare it to the result in parallel simulation.



For parallel simulation, cd parallel
run make and it will generate a program called test_parallel
To run this program,


mpirun -np [num_of_processes] test_parallel [num_of_rows] [num_of_cols] 
[generation] [input_name] [output_name]

To validate the correctness of this program, run 
mpirun -np 500 500 5 large_input large_output and compare it with the results with sequential input 


To run the test at the same time, run testall.sh
